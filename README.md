## Background

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library: http://opencv.org) is an
open-source BSD-licensed library that includes several hundreds of computer
vision algorithms. It's mainly developed in C++. This library provides Rust
bindings to access OpenCV functionalities. First, C bindings are created
(in [native](native) folder); then [Rust APIs](src/lib.rs) are constructed
atop. Although this manual process seems an inefficient process, it has served
me well as a learning experience to both OpenCV and Rust. In terms of OpenCV API
coverage, modules and functions are implemented as needed.

Please check out the [documentation](https://nebgnahz.github.io/cv-rs/cv/) to
see what has been ported. If you have demand for porting specific features,
please open an issue, or better create a PR.

Attempts to use [rust-bindgen](https://github.com/servo/rust-bindgen)
or [cpp_to_rust](https://github.com/rust-qt/cpp_to_rust) haven't been very
successful (I probably haven't tried hard enough). There is another
port [opencv-rust](https://github.com/kali/opencv-rust/) which generates OpenCV
bindings using a Python script (more automated).

## Install

Before anything, make sure you have OpenCV 3 installed. Read this
[Introduction to OpenCV](http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/df/d65/tutorial_table_of_content_introduction.html) to get started.

Then in any Rust project, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
cv = "0.1.0"
```

And add this to your crate:

```
extern crate cv;
use cv::*;
```

And then, enjoy the power of OpenCV.
